        <h1>Paths to Food Justice:</h1>
        <p>Though there are many critiques to be made in the typical efforts being used to combat food insecurity, there is no need to lose hope in the capability of human resilience. Many activists living in food insecure communities have been making wide strides to ensure healthy, affordable food is available and sustainable. In addition to connecting people with the food they need to support healthy lives, these efforts are working to educate, empower, and support disenfranchised communities in the hopes of developing more civically engaged consumers in the food system. Though the fight is slow, every small victory builds momentum for the next big change. </p>

                <p>Urban farms are exactly what they sound like. Typically, an organization will adopt a plot of land within an impoverished urban area and develop it to produce dozens of varieties of fresh produce to be redistributed across the neighborhood. These efforts are supported by volunteers who are directed by farm managers. Members of the community are welcome to tend to the beds and learn about the effort that goes into the production of food. As well, these opportunities offer great professional development experience, offer forums to speak on issues regarding food access, and promote cultural knowledge exchange.</p>
                <p>                    
                    Specifically, in Englewood, Janelle St. John supports Growing Home Farm by selling to local restaurants who serve a more elite crowd. With this revenue, the farm can support 1.5 acres and over 150 varieties of vegetable and herbs. The farm is the only USDA certified organic farm in the city and offers workforce development and computer training. St. John is also working on overcoming the surrounding community’s shared perception that health food is just for “those foodie people, or those earthy or vegan people.” The farm delivers 200 CSA boxes to the community and donates produce to the Great Chicago Food Depository. In addition to job training and food assistance, the garden supports legislation that expands food access in the community. Bringing consumers directly into the production of food is critical for regaining power in the food system</p>

                <p>Food Policy councils are collections of community members, business owners, healthcare workers, politicians, and other stakeholders that organize to set policy goals and advocate on behalf of the community. These are critical resources to have in areas that are often overlooked by state and local legislature typically on the basis of low income or racial marginalization. By offering a space to pool ideas and resources, communities are strengthened despite being offered pitiful resources from their leaders. These venues also minimize the gap that often exists between food system leaders and individual consumers. </p>
                <p>Fee-Fo-Lay Café was opened in 2019 by Jo and Joy Banner in Wallace, LA  as a bakery. Though the café is nestled within a rural community hosting no more than 775 people, it is surrounded by pollution coming from industrial activity across the Mississippi River. Atlantic Alumina factory, Marathon Petroleum refinery, and Shell Norco’s petrochemical plant are all looming over the community. The pollution in the air is the source of the area’s nickname “Cancer Alley.” This represents an instance of the pattern where low income, black communities are optimal placement for high pollution activities. The Descendants project was founded by the same sisters in 2020 to defend Wallace from this industrial development. Though the sisters originally wanted to run the café to produce authentic New Orleans style cookies, they instead opted to devote their space and efforts towards protecting their community through organizing and activism. As well as preserving the health of future generations, the residents who visit the café are united to the many past generations that worked the land as enslaved laborers. Here is an opportunity to use the avenue of food to connect with the past while working towards a more equitable, healthy future.</p>

                <p>Mobile Meal trucks are also included in food assistance programs that are commonly seen across the country. Meals on wheels is a recognizeable example for offering dinner to the food insecure elderly. This method of food distribution overcomes geographic barriers to food access. Many low income families do not have cars to take them to grocery stores that are often situated in high income neighborhoods. As well, public transportation is not often designed to deliver people to those grocery stores in a timely way. DCCK also employs concepts from the free/reduced meal program, but it supplies low income students with food during summer vacation. </p>
                <p>Founded in 2010, the DCCK mobile meal trucks provide food for 19 DC area schools. The organization gathered input from the community on how best to serve the needs of students who rely on school sponsored meals. They learned that the need is very high and are expected to expand their offerings to 25,000 meals per day. In order to make sure people are not turned off of the problem from the stigma associated with receiving food assistance, families do not have to register to receive these meals. This effort is also known to partner with prominent groups in the community like the Washington Nationals and the Washington Wizards to garner recognition and funding for the fight against food apartheid. DC Central Kitchen also hosts a 36,000 square food facility that offers healthy food, job training, community engagement, and social enterprise. Programs like this demonstrate how fighting food insecurity takes more than just food, but requires the programs that support of the growth and development of community.</p>

            <div><p>An important aspect of food security is having access to culturally significant foods. One of the most vulnerable groups to food insecurity are the indigenous. A large part of the colonial domination of indigenous communities has been decimation of food ways. Ranchers moving out west would destroy bison populations that plains native americans needed to survive. The US government forced these communities to then take food rations that were nothing short of pitiful to further decimate those communities. Low access to heritage foods impacts long term health and allows cultural knowledge to disappear with each passing generation. </p>
                <p>Mariah Gladstone is the CEO and founder of Indigikitchen. Indigikitchen is an online resource offering healthy recipes and education on native American foodways. In addition to offering the skills needs to prepare healthy meals, this business works to “strengthen the ties to our cultures and reminds (native people) of the inherent worth of (their) identities.” Indigiktichen’s Gladstone often makes in person appearances to offer lessons in nutrition and food sovereignty in addition to providing online resources. While the United States food system thrives on high volume of fast food and convenient eating, Gladstone encourages her audiences to recognize the long history of hyperlocal eating that precedes them. This particular intervention offers a more individualistic approach to remediating food security, but an consumer based approached is often appropriate for cultural preservation.   </p>

        <div>
            <div><a href="https://civileats.com/2023/06/14/the-struggle-for-food-sovereignty-in-immokalee-florida/"><img src="ciw2.jpeg" alt="coalition of immokalee workers on the picket" width="20%"></a></div>
            <div>
                <p>The pinnacle of irony in the food system is the fact that a large majority of people working in the food system are food insecure. This is typically due to the low wages offered from food industry jobs. Low wages intensely limit where laborers can live, and low income areas have weak food infrastructure. Many farmworkers and food processors are also migrants from Mexico and Central America. Federal food assistance is only offered to citizens of the US, so these can’t even access that basic resource. Luckily, there is a growing movement fighting for the rights of farm laborers. Labor groups across the country are pushing for high wages, better workplace protection, more benefits, and better living accommodations.</p>
                <p>One such group is the Coalition of Immokalee Workers. Immokalee, FL is known as the tomato capital of the United States, and 28% of the town’s residents live below the federal poverty line. Most of these residents are migrant workers from Central America, Mexico, and Haiti. Many of the residents rely on mutual aid because they can’t afford to buy the materials they need from the store. Small scale farms, foraging, and donated meals keep these folks satisfied. The Coalition of Immokalee Workers (ICW) is a high profile advocacy group that pioneered the Fair Food Program. This began in 2010 to push food retailers to only buy from distributors that paid their farmworkers a livable wage. After years of organizing and grueling effort, McDonalds, Walmart, Whole Foods, and Trader Joes have all agreed to source their tomatoes from producers that ensure dignity for their laborers. Many food security issues are really at the hands of big food giants, so pushing these corporations to take action to protect their most vulnerable employees is critical for universal food justice. </p>

            <div><img src="../project4/The-Future.png" alt="picket signs with hopes for the future of the food system"></div>
            <div> <p>There are interventions to be made in all parts of the food system, from production to consumption. Many creative minds across the country are working very hard to organize interested parties for the goal of solidifying human dignity into the food system. This website was very limited in just talking about contemporary interventions across the US. There are communities that struggle all over the world with food insecurity. Luckily, the FAO has found that food insecurity is experienced similarly across the globe, so successful interventions from the US have the capability to bring about progress in other parts of the world, and vice versa. Though we can celebrate these victories demonstrated above, there are still many battles yet to be fought. Thank you for taking the time to learn about these important topics especially if you are privileged enough to have low familiarity with these issues. Please keep sharing this information and learning about how to fight food apartheid, and, of course, Get Involved!!!</p></div>
