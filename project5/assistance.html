        <h1>Introduction to Emergency Food Systems</h1> 
         <p>The term “food assistance” and “emergency food systems” refer to resources employed support food access among food insecure individuals with the intention of fostering economic mobility. These programs operate on the federal, state, and local/private levels. The federal programs are signed into law by the US government as a part of the Farm Bill (link). Programs like SNAP, WIC and Free Breakfast are orchestrated through state offices with federal dollars. State and local programs can include food pantries and food banks which can either be publicly or privately funded. This page will elaborate on each of these programs and recognize some shortcomings. It is important to recognize that many food assistance efforts currently in place do very little to address root causes of food insecurity (see block element*). These efforts can be very critical to filling the nutritive gaps left by those systemic barriers to food access, but they struggle to meet the ever growing number demand of people requesting these resources.</p>

                <h2>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP):</h2>
               <p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps) is a program under the USDA. It offers a monthly allowance to families to spend at participating food retailers to feed their household. Eligibility for snap is determined by household income, and individuals must register with their state office. SNAP benefits are available on an Electronic Benefit Transfer card (EBT) that acts like a debit card. This money can be spent on fresh produce, meats, dairy products, breads/cereals, snack foods, and seeds/plants. Hot foods, alcohol, drugs, cleaning supplies, and pet food are not covered by SNAP.</p>
               <p><Strong>Limitations:</Strong></p>
               <ul>
                    <li>SNAP benefits are often not enough to cover the prices of a varied, robust diet</li>
                    <li>Not available to felons or undocumented US residents</li>
                    <li>Applying for SNAP has high stigma around it and can be a confusing process</li>
                    <li>Can't be used to buy ready-to-eat food</li>
               </ul>

                <h2>Special SNAP for Women, Infants, and Children:</h2>
                <p>The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children expands the benefits of SNAP to include particular needs of mothers. Federal grants support the purchasing of supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education for low-income, pregnant, and non-breastfeeding postpartum women, infants, and children under age of 5 who are at nutritional risk. Authorized foods include baby foods, formula, medical foods, in addition to the foods allowed by SNAP. Applicants must be found to be at nutrition risk to be eligible. Nutrition risk is identified as anemia, underweight, history of pregnancy complications, failure to meet current dietary guidelines. </p>  
                <p><Strong>Limitations:</Strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Low variation in financial packages despite high variation of need presented in those receiving benefits </li>
                    <li>No provisions for scheduling and transportation required to access benefits</li>
                    <li>Participation across the country varies dramatically. Portion of the population who are eligible is growing steadily, but enrollment is not.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Free/Reduced Meal Programs:</h2>
                <p>School Breakfast Program has been offering free meals in public and private schools across the country since 1975. The Black Panther Party actually first pioneered this program in the 1960s in Oakland, CA. State agencies now run this program in collaboration with local school districts. Meals offered through this program are required to meet Federal nutrition standards. Revenue lost by offering free and reduced cost meals is reimbursed by the USDA. Children from families with incomes at or below 130% of the federal poverty level are eligible for the program. Access to meals in school is critical for supporting prolonged focus, good mood, and strong academic performance. </p>
                <p><Strong>Limitations:</Strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Children are shameful or bullied for using this resource and may forego meals</li>
                    <li>Foods are prepared at extremely low cost sacrificing taste and local preferences</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Food Banks</h2>
                <p><strong>Regionally Run with Federal Support:</strong> <br> </p>
                <p>Food banks are store houses for donated, purchased, and federally financed food that is distributed across some area to food pantries. Not to be confused with food pantries, food banks are more like a warehouse than collects the food rather than directly giving it to people who need it. Food Banks get public funding to host a variety of other programs like nutrition education, SNAP/public assistance registration, and budgeting workshops. Some food banks may even have a food policy council affiliated with it. These group bring together stakeholders across the community to establish goals for ensuring community food access and advocating for relevant policy.  </p>
                <p><Strong>Limitations:</Strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>May be unaware of the tastes and preferences of local pantries</li>
                    <li>Criticized for not using enough resources to advocate for structural reform</li>
                    <li>Commodity food (shelf stable, surplus food) offered through The Emergency Food Assistance Program supports consolidated agriculture interests</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Food Pantry:</h2>
                <p><strong>Regionally and Privately run with Federal support</strong> <br> </p>
                <p> Food pantries and organizations like soup kitchens are the most common types of food assistance we interact with. These services are typically run by non profit, religious institutions, but there are a few publically-run pantries across the country. Pantries function by collecting donations of food and redistributing products to their members. Pantries can also go mobile to serve people who may not otherwise have transportation to the brick and mortar location. Either way, food is typically distributed weekly and donations from local farms and community members can ensure that the meals cover all 5 food groups to curate a nutritious meal.</p>
                <p><Strong>Limitations:</Strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Food Drives collect ultra-processed, high sodium, out of date food to be distributed to vulnerable populations</li>
                    <li>Aging infrastructure of the physical institutions present high cost of maintenance that is dependent on donations and grants</li>
                    <li>Intended to be a temporary resource, but most patrons regularly use this for weekly food allowance</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Food Recovery/Gleaning:</h2>
                <p><strong>Regionally and Privately Directed</strong> <br> </p>
                <p>Leftover food from grocers, dining facilities, and restaurants are often thrown out at the end of the day to preserve food safety. There are many volunteer efforts however to take this food from the source to distribute among communities in need. Recovered food can go to food banks, low-cost food retailers, or directly to community support agencies. This is a great method of reducing food waste and hunger, but is criticized for ignoring the preferences and dignity of the recipients</p>
                <p><Strong>Limitations:</Strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Food donations can be unreliable, and little choice is offered to patrons receiving food</li>
                    <li>Stigma associated with consuming recovered food hurts public image of these programs</li>
                    <li>No federal legislation protecting organizations from liability when donating recovered food (deters businesses from providing food) </li>
                </ul>

                <p>These are just a few programs that are offered to limit the impacts of food insecurity. It is important to recognize though that these programs do not actively dismantle the causes of food security. While it is important to have resources that fill in the gaps, leaving these systematic barriers to food access will simply perpetuate the population growth of people who need these resources. The term “emergency food system” then becomes a bit inappropriate as people simply access these resources regularly because they are stuck in poverty. </p>
