        <h1>Introduction to Emergency Food Systems:</h1> 
         <p >The term “food assistance” and “emergency food systems” refer to resources employed to support food access among food insecure individuals with the intention of fostering economic mobility. These programs operate on the federal, state, and local/private levels. The federal programs are enshrined in law, and the budgets are determined every 5 years as a part of the US Farm Bill. Programs like SNAP, Free Breakfast, and WIC are only available to US citizens and orchestrated through state offices with federal dollars. State and local programs can include food pantries, food banks, and food recovery which can either be publicly or privately funded. This page will elaborate on each of these programs and recognize some shortcomings. It is important to recognize that many food assistance efforts currently in place do very little to address root causes of food insecurity. These efforts can be very critical to filling the nutritive gaps left by those systemic barriers to food access, but they struggle to meet the ever growing number demand of people requesting these resources.</p>

                <div>
                    <p>The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly known as food stamps) is directed by the USDA. It offers a monthly allowance to families to spend at participating food retailers to feed their household. Eligibility for SNAP is determined by household income, and individuals must register with their state office. SNAP benefits are available on an Electronic Benefit Transfer card (EBT) that acts like a debit card. This money can be spent on fresh produce, meats, dairy products, breads/cereals, snack foods, and seeds/plants. Hot foods, alcohol, drugs, cleaning supplies, and pet food are not covered by SNAP.</p>

                         <li>Not available to felons or undocumented US residents</li>
                         <li>Applying for SNAP has high stigma around it and can be a confusing process</li>
                         <li>People lacking ability to space to prepare food can't by ready to eat food</li>

                <div>
                    <p>The National School Lunch Program has been offering free and reduced price meals in public and private schools across the country since 1975. The Black Panther Party actually first pioneered a Free Breakfast Program in the 1960s in Oakland, CA which was quickly adopted by the federal government. State agencies run this program in collaboration with local school districts. Meals offered are required to meet Federal nutrition standards. Revenue lost by offering free and reduced cost meals is reimbursed by the USDA. Children from families with incomes under 185% of the federal poverty level are eligible for the program. Access to meals in school is critical for supporting prolonged focus, good mood, and strong academic performance. </p>

                    <p>The Special Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program for Women, Infants, and Children expands the benefits of SNAP to include particular needs of mothers and their young children. Federal grants support the purchasing of supplemental foods, health care referrals, and nutrition education for low-income, pregnant, and non-breastfeeding postpartum women, infants, and children under age of 5 who are at nutritional risk. Authorized foods include baby foods, formula, medical foods, in addition to the foods allowed by SNAP. Applicants must be found to be at nutrition risk to be eligible. Nutrition risk is identified as anemia, underweight, history of pregnancy complications, and failure to meet current dietary guidelines. </p>

                    <p>Food banks are store houses for donated, purchased, and federally financed food that is distributed across some area to food pantries. Not to be confused with food pantries, food banks are more like a warehouse that collects the food rather than directly gives it to people who need it. Food Banks get public funding to host a variety of other programs like nutrition education, SNAP/public assistance registration, and budgeting workshops. Some food banks may even have a food policy council affiliated with it. These groups bring together stakeholders across the community to establish goals that support community food access.  </p>

                    <p> Food pantries and organizations like soup kitchens are the most common types of food assistance we interact with. These services are typically run by non profit, religious institutions, but there are a few publically-run pantries across the country. Pantries function by collecting donations of food and redistributing products to their patrons. Pantries can also go mobile to serve people who may not otherwise have transportation to the brick and mortar location. Either way, food is typically distributed weekly and donations from local farms and community members can ensure that the meals cover all 5 food groups to curate a nutritious meal.</p>

                    <p>Leftover food from grocers, dining facilities, and restaurants are often thrown out at the end of the day to preserve food safety. There are many volunteer efforts, however, to take this food from the source to distribute among communities in need. Recovered food can go to food banks, low-cost food retailers, or directly to community support agencies. This is a great method of reducing food waste and hunger, but is criticized for ignoring the preferences and dignity of the recipients</p>

                <p>These are just a few programs that work to limit the impacts of food insecurity. It is important to recognize  that these programs do not actively dismantle the causes of food security. While it is important to have resources that fill in the gaps, leaving these systematic barriers to food access unaddressed will simply perpetuate the growth of the population who needs these resources. The term “emergency food system” has become a bit inappropriate as people access these resources regularly because they are stuck in poverty. </p>
